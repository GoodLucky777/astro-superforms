description: How to automatically setup the Astro Superforms integration.
---
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This integration eases the use of **Superforms** in your **Astro** projects by:
- mimicking `sveltekit` types and methods used by **Superforms**
- providing types and helpers specific to **Astro**

## Installation

Astro includes an `astro add` command to automate the setup of official integrations. If you prefer, you can [install integrations manually](/start-here/manual-setup) instead.

<Steps>

1. To install `astro-superforms`, run the following from your project directory and follow the prompts:

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="npm">
        ```shell
        npx astro add astro-superforms
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="pnpm">
        ```shell
        pnpm astro add astro-superforms
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="yarn">
        ```shell
        yarn astro add astro-superforms
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

</Steps>

If you run into any issues, [feel free to report them to us on GitHub](https://github.com/gbouteiller/astro-superforms/issues) and try the manual setup instead.
